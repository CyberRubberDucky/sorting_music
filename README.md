# Sorting Visualizer with Pygame, NumPy, and Matplotlib

This project implements a sorting algorithm visualizer using Python and several libraries including `pygame`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. It provides audio-visual feedback for sorting algorithms through animations and sound.

---

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms Visualized**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
- **Audio Feedback**:
  - Each sorting operation plays a frequency-modulated sound based on the value being sorted.
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - The sorting process is displayed graphically using bars to represent array elements.
  - Colors are used to highlight active or recently modified elements.
- Algorithm runtime is displayed in real-time (both seconds and milliseconds).

---

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- **pygame** 
  - For audio playback.
- **numpy**
  - Used for mathematical operations and generating audio waveforms.
- **matplotlib**
  - For visualizing sorting processes as bar plots.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python sorting_visualizer.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Audio Feedback**:
   - The sound frequency for sorting operations is generated by mapping the array value to a frequency range from **400 Hz to 2000 Hz**.
   - A sine wave is dynamically generated and played using `pygame`'s sound system.

2. **Visualization**:
   - The sorting process is represented by horizontal bars where the heights correspond to array values.
   - Active elements are highlighted using colors:
     - **Yellow**: Currently being sorted.
     - **Purple**: Recently moved element.

3. **Algorithms**:
   - Each algorithm is implemented with step-by-step visualization updates and plays distinct sounds for operations.

---

## Usage

The application automatically runs each of the four sorting algorithms sequentially:

1. Generates a randomized array of values between 1 and 100.
2. For each algorithm:
   - Creates a copy of the array.
   - Visualizes the sorting process with sounds and bar animations.
3. Repeats continuously.

You can interrupt the program anytime using `Ctrl+C`.

## Code Overview

### Core Functions

#### 1. **`play_sound(value)`**
   - Generates a sine wave corresponding to the given `value` and plays it as audio.
   - Frequency dynamically adjusts based on the value's proportion in the array.

#### 2. **`print_array(...)`**
   - Updates the terminal with a textual representation of the array.
   - Updates the Matplotlib plot to visually show changes as the algorithm progresses.

#### 3. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Each algorithm is implemented as a function:
     - `bubble_sort`
     - `selection_sort`
     - `insertion_sort`
     - `merge_sort`
   - Sorting actions (comparisons, swaps, etc.) update the plot and play sounds.

---

## Customization

- To change the array size, modify `list(range(1, 101))` in the `run_sorting_algorithms()` method.
- Adding new algorithms:
  1. Define the new sorting function with the same function signature.
  2. Append it to the `sorting_algorithms` list.

## Libraries Used

- **pygame:** For sound generation and playback.
- **numpy:** For efficient numeric computation of sound waveforms.
- **matplotlib:** For real-time graphical visualization of sorting.

## Sample Output

### Visualization Example:
The sorting process is represented with graphical bars:

- **Unsorted Array**:
  ```
  75  90  23  12  38  ...
  ------------------------------------
  ```
  
- **Sorting Process**:
  - Yellow bar → Currently sorted.
  - Purple bar → Recently swapped element.
